Kani's collection of random toy problems

Hello
If your here and looking at these toy problems and solutions keep looking and I only hope that they serve you in a good way.
These are some problmes i started working on when I started to learn JavaScript.
Some problems have multiple solutions just for kicks.
All of them need heavy refactoring.
This is not to say how a problems should be approached in the most efficient way.
It is just how I tackled them with my limited time and knowledge on JavaScript.
Anyways hope it helps you and happy JS.
